Discuss the different types of DDBMS. Also, highlight the major advantages and disadvantages associated with using a distributed database system.

Compare the client-server and peer-to-peer architectures in distributed databases. What are the key design challenges associated with global directory management and data	7

Consider a Customer table with attributes (CustID, Name, Address, Phone, Email, CreditLimit). Propose a vertical fragmentation and describe how you would allocate the resulting fragments across two regional databases. Justify your allocation strategy with potential performance benefits.

How can semantic data control be enforced using views in a distributed database system? Discuss with an example how a view can be used to restrict access to sensitive attributes in a healthcare database distributed across multiple hospitals.	8

Explain the role of query decomposition in distributed query processing. With a suitable example, describe how a high-level SQL query is broken down and optimized across multiple sites.
Explain the concept of localization of distributed data in query processing. How does effective localization improve the efficiency of query execution in a fragmented distributed database?	8


4	Given the following schemas:
Student(StudentID, Name, Age, DeptID)
Department(DeptID, DeptName, Location)
Course(CourseID, CourseName, DeptID)
Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID, Grade)
a)	Write SQL queries for the following:
i.	List the names of students and their corresponding department names.
ii.	Find all courses offered by the 'Computer Science' department.
iii.	Retrieve the names of students who scored a grade 'A' in any course.
iv.	Find the names of students enrolled in courses offered by departments located in 'New York'.
b)	Write Relational Algebra on:
i.	Retrieve the names of all students who are enrolled in any course.
ii.	Find the details of departments located in 'Boston'.
iii.	List the CourseIDs and CourseNames of all courses offered
by the department with DeptName = 'Computer Science'.
iv.	Find the StudentIDs and Grades of students who scored an 'A' grade in any course.	

Explain lock-based concurrency control with the two-phase locking protocol in a distributed DBMS. Given the following sequence of lock requests by transactions T1 and T2 on data items A and B, determine if the schedule is conflict-serializable and explain why:
T1 acquires a shared lock on A
T2 requests an exclusive lock on A (must wait)
T1 acquires a shared lock on B
T1 releases the lock on A
T1 releases the lock on B
T2 acquires an exclusive lock on A"
Explain the different types of failures that can occur in a distributed database system. How do local reliability protocols address these failures, and what limitations do they have compared to distributed reliability protocols?

What are the main parallel DBMS techniques used to improve query performance? Illustrate with examples how data partitioning and pipelining can lead to parallel execution problems, and suggest possible solutions.
Explain the role of cost-based optimization in distributed query processing. Illustrate with an example how a distributed query optimization algorithm chooses the best query execution plan across multiple sites
Write Short notes on (any two)
a)	Distributed integrity control
b)	Transaction management
c)	Concurrency management	2*5=10
